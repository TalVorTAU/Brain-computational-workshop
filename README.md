# Brain-computational-workshop
This repository contains the code used in the project for 'Workshop on Computational Methods in Brain Research' course, titled "Supernumerary Effector Motor Imagery Classification in Brain-Computer-Interfaces With Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks" <br><br>
The full pipeline is implemented in main.ipynb. <br>
Other files are auxiliary and provide implementations of functions used in main.
